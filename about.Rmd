<h1>About Me </h1>


My name is Qiu Xia, but I go by Helen. I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My concentration is in Epidemiology with a certificate in Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases. My research interest is in neurological epidemiology, specifically risk factors for dementia in older adults. I am also passionate about using research to improve health outcomes in the elderly and immigrant populations. Read more about my research work [here](research.html)!

Since starting my masters program, I found a new interest in data science. My epidemiology training and biostatistics coursework gave me deeper understanding into various statistical modeling techniques used in public health research. Additionally, my data science course prepared me with necessary tools for the complete pipeline for data analysis. These skills include exploratory analysis, visualization, and data wrangling. I also learned how to build this whole website using R! To see my sample data science work, click [here](exercise.html) and [here](assignment.html). In addition to R, I also have professional experience in SAS, MS Access, and MySQL. Click on my [resume](cv.html) to learn more!

Prior to New York City, I was in Boston for my undergradute studies. Although I am loving the East Coast, I am originally from Honolulu, Hawaii! I love going back home to visit my family and friends whenever I can. Below is a picture that I took of the beach when I was back home last year! I enjoy taking photography and traveling!
