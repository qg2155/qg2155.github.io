Set up dataset
```{r}
data(rest_inspec)
```

Count of grades(A, B, C) among boroughs 
```{r bargraph}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(boro != "Missing", 
        grade %in% c("A", "B", "C")) %>% 
  group_by(boro, grade) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~boro, y = ~n, type = 'bar',
          name = ~grade, color = ~grade) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Count of grades (A, B, C) by borough",
    xaxis = list(title = "Borough"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of grade")
  )
```

Distribution of scores by years
```{r boxplot}
rest_inspec %>%
  separate(grade_date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  select(-month, -day) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score),
         year != 2012) %>% 
  group_by(year, score) %>% 
  summarize(avg_scores = mean(score)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~avg_scores, color = ~year, type = 'box') %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Distribution of scores by years",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Scores")
  )
```

Average score by borough over time
```{r}
rest_inspec %>%
  separate(grade_date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  select(-month, -day) %>%
  filter(boro != "Missing",
         !is.na(score),
         year != 2012) %>%

  layout(
    title = "Average scores across years by borough",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Average scores")
  )
